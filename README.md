# HandDetectionProject

This repository contains a hand tracking module built using OpenCV. The module is designed to detect and track hands in real-time using a webcam or video input. Leveraging computer vision techniques, it identifies hand landmarks and allows for further gesture recognition and interaction possibilities.

<h2>Features:</h2>

Real-Time Tracking: Tracks hand movements in real-time using OpenCV.

Hand Landmark Detection: Detects key points on the hand, such as fingertips and joints.

Easy Integration: Can be easily integrated into other projects involving gesture recognition or hand-based controls.

Customizable: Parameters and thresholds can be adjusted to suit various lighting conditions and hand sizes.

<h2>Requirements:</h2>
Python 3.x,
OpenCV
Mediapipe (optional, for enhanced landmark detection)
Numpy
